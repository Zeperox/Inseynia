<h3>Welcome to Bolgerna!</h3>
<p>The land of mystery, magic, prosperity, and mystic powers. But make sure you donâ€™t dive in too deep; otherwise, you will regret it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Anyways, this is where you can look at the code and help find issues that you probably found while testing. We appreciate your help ðŸ™‚</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>this only works on Windows so far, we will add Mac and Linux support soon</p>
