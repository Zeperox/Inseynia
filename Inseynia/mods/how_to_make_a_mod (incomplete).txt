So you want to make an Inseynia mod eh?
well, it'll take a while to get accustomed to, it this guide should hopefully make it easy to comprehend


1) TEXTURE PACKS
required knowledge: art & json (if you're facing troubles with sizes or rotations)

texture packs are probably the simplest thing you could do, you just basically copy the assets folder into your mod folder, and edit the sprites, but there are still some stuff worth knowing:
- sprites must ALWAYS be a png image
- you can add "DL" (Don't Load) at the end of an image name to tell the game not to load the image, or you can add it to a folder to let the game skip the entire folder

if you want to edit the json file as well, add a "scripts" folder to your mod folder and add a json file named "sprite data.json", keep in mind this:
- if you don't add an image in the json file the game will use the default
- the structure of the json file should be as follows:
{
    "exact_image_name_without_.png": { // you can leave empty for a raw image or you can add one or more of the following
        "convert": null OR [r, g, b], // the rgb value is basically which color to remove, could be useful with sprites that include uncolored pixels since these are converted to black upon converting
        "alpha": null,
        "flip" [true/false, true/false], // xflip, yflip
        "scale": intval OR [intval, intval], // you can put a single number to make the image scale up by multiplying its size with the number, adding 2 in a list means that the image will scale up to the size of the numbers, ignoring the image's original size
        "rotate": degrees
    }
}
