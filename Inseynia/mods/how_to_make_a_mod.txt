So you want to make an Inseynia mod eh?
well, it'll take a while to get accustomed to, but this basic how-to should hopefully get you started

First of all before doing anything, you must have a "data.json" file inside your mod folder with this data:
{
    "type": STR         the type, "asset" or "behavior" or "addon"
    "name": STR         the display name of the mod
    "info": STR/NULL    extra info about your mod or "null"
    "icon": LIST/NULL   the path from the mod's directory to the icon as a list or "null"
}

1) Asset Pack
The asset pack replaces the default assets, it is the simplest thing to do
Equiping an asset pack will unequip every other asset pack, keep that in mind

In order to make an asset pack, there are a few things to note:
- All new assets MUST have the same name and file type as the original
- You can add extra assets but they won't be used in-game
- Most assets MUST have the same dimensions as the original, but some can be different. Play around with your own risk
- There isn't a need to worry if you have your icon name as something used in-game since the game will automatically ignore it


2) Behavior Pack
The behavior pack replaces the default code files of the game except the main file, might be difficult due to certain restrictions
Equiping a behavior pack will unequip every other behavior pack, keep that in mind

In order to make a Behavior pack, there are a few things to note:
- All new code MUST have the same file name and class name as the original
- DO NOT remove any variables or methods used in the original classes
- You cannot play around with the json or csv files
- You can add extra files but they won't be used in-game
- Weapons, AI, and quests MUST be in a directory, with the directory name being the same as original
- RECOMMENDATION: You could import the original class and build upon it like so: "class MyClass(DefaultClass):", and by using "super().default_method(args)" inside your replacement method
- You cannot replace the main loop, the window initialization, and the loading files

3) Add-ons
This is basically a full-on mod, this cannot however be used in a similar way as an asset or behavior pack
just go ham!

There are a few things to note though:
- Every weapon, AI, and quest has to be its own file
- Weapons, AI and quests MUST be in a directory, with the directory name being the same as original
- You cannot replace the default json or csv files, only add to them
- You cannot replace or add to the map
- It is recommended (and mandatory if you're adding AI, weapons, or quests) to follow a similar directory path as the default one
